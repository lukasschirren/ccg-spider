# Spider

This is a tool developed by [Chris Arderne](https://github.com/carderne/) for the [CCG Program](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.com/) at the University of Oxford.

There are two main directories:
1. [prep](prep/) for the GIS data loading and Python scripts to load them into a single `GeoJSON` that the app can use.
2. [frontend](frontend/) for the interactive web-app that loads that output file.
